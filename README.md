Simple Calendar that starts with the current month.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89c63fae-2ac8-4484-933d-cf8e101f42a5)

It generates month using userControl called ucDay, by loading the needed amount of them in the floating Panel.
Each ucDay has a label for the date (1, 2, ... 30, 31) and the checkbox. When I click on the day, it changes the color of border. 

I have seven labels in the Form for days of the week and the label for month and year. I also have two paintBoxes with arrows and on click they move between months.

Planned features:
- making calendar resizable
- add a dropdown list of color themes
- add an image to the ucDay - either like a background or like a small icon for birthdays and so on. can it be a dropdown list with icons as well?
- highlight Sundays and public holidays - both inside the ucDay (so change the color of its label) and in the Form - change the color of the label "Sunday" of the Form).
